Windows 7/Vista/8/10(?) 64-bit driver for the Actlabs ForceRS force feedback wheel

Refer to the ForceRS Driver Installation v1.5.pdf file for installation instructions

This driver must be installed with driver signing disabled, but will function correctly (with driver signing enabled) thereafter.

The method for disabling driver signing is different for each version of Windows and can be easily found with a quick search.

SPECIAL THANKS: To Brian Zager for identifying the steps required for Windows to recognize that the drivers are digitally signed.
